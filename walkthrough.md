# Scenario Walk-Through

## Common use case
The user opens the program at 2 PM. He plans to make progress on a math assignment, so he creates a task to get one hour of work done. In the command line, he creates a task named “Math Work,” which is a 1-hour block for work between 2 PM to 3 PM. The UserFunctions class will add this task to the list of Tasks in the TaskTracker class. The Timeline class will then add this task into its TaskMap in the 2 PM time block.
