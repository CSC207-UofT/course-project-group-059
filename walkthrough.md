# Scenario Walk-Through

## Common use case
The user opens the program at 2 PM. He plans to make progress on a math assignment, so he creates a task to get one hour of work done. In the command line, he creates a task named “Math Work,” which is a 1-hour block for work between 2 PM to 3 PM. The program will take inputs in the command line for the name of the task ("Math Work"), the start date (today, in YYYY-MM-DD format), the start time (14:00), the end date (also today), and the end time (15:00). Every other variable can left blank. The task is then added to the listOfTasks in TaskTracker, and the Task list is printed out.
