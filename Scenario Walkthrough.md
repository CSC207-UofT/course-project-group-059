# Scenario Walk-Through

The user opens the program in the morning. The system creates a suggestion of the tasks that should be done for the day using the Create Suggestion method in the To-do list class. Some Task objects, like lectures, are set as recurring weekly with a set time. These Task objects are already placed into the Timelineâ€™s map in their corresponding TimeBlocks. One Task object is a recurring computer science lecture from 12 PM to 2 PM, so for example, it will be placed in the 12 PM and 1 PM TimeBlocks in the map. Based on all the information he sees, he starts planning his day by adding tasks into the timeline. He needs to work on a math assignment, so he creates a 2-hour block for work between 2 PM to 4 PM. After returning from the lecture, he starts the Pomodoro timer using the Pomodoro System class to help him focus. The timer activates the alarm at the end of each 25-minute work period and 5-minute break period. He finishes the assignment at 4 PM, so the system counts 4 Pomodoros completed. He evaluates how he feels about the task by writing a short note about his productivity.
